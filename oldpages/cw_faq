### 1. What is the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup about?
	
The #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup is part of the Government’s efforts to partner Singaporeans to co-create and co-deliver solutions. 

#### Our challenge

The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has jumped seven-fold over the past 40 years. Although we incinerate our waste to conserve space at our only landfill, Semakau Landfill will be filled up by 2035 if we continue to waste resources at our current rate. To address this, we need everyone to make it a habit to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

About 60 per cent of Singaporean households are already recycling regularly. Unfortunately, many do not realise that items soiled with food and liquids should not be put into the blue recycling bin. Food and liquids contaminate other recyclables in the blue bin, which then have to be trashed rather than recycled. Today, the contamination rate of blue recycling bins is high, at 40 per cent. 

If we can improve the way we recycle, we can collect back items which might otherwise have been trashed. The recyclables can be made into new products such as construction materials and furniture. Recycling will therefore enable us to turn trash into treasure. This will allow us to keep our precious and finite resources in use for as long as possible, instead of drawing on new resources. This is what we call a [circular economy](/circular-economy/) approach. 

#### Join us!

The [Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR)](http://www.mewr.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} is working with the [Institute of Policy Studies (IPS)](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips){:target="_blank"} to recruit Singaporeans to form a Citizens’ Workgroup. The Workgroup will work with MEWR to co-create solutions to improve the way we recycle at home.  

Participants will be given access to background information about household recycling in Singapore. They will also be given access to policy-relevant information like household recycling surveys as well as resource persons who can share their expertise and help with the piloting and implementation of solutions. 

Through the Citizens’ Workgroup, we aim to go beyond consulting citizens, to working together with citizens. After the sessions are over, we encourage participants to continue working with us and our partners to make their recommendations a reality, and to encourage others to participate as well. 

### 2. Who will make up the workgroup?
	
We are selecting around 50 citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) from diverse backgrounds. MEWR already has existing platforms to engage partners (e.g. Partners for the Environment Forum and [Zero Waste Masterplan Consultation Sessions](/consultation/), but we also want to hear from citizens who have not been previously involved in these engagements. These may include those who actively recycle, do not recycle, and those who are keen to recycle but feel that they do not have enough information to do so. The aim is to work with a diverse group of citizens to co-create solutions that are by citizens, for citizens. 

We also welcome partners or individuals active in the waste and recycling scene to be involved in the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup as resource persons. The Workgroup participants can then tap on the experience and technical knowledge of these partners to ensure that their recommendations are well-informed and robust. Partners and active individuals can volunteer to be resource persons by emailing [mewr_feedback@mewr.gov.sg](mailto:mewr_feedback@mewr.gov.sg?subject=Recycle Right Citizens Workgroup). MEWR will call on the resource persons based on the requirements of the Citizens’ Workgroup.
	
### 3.Can I be in the Citizens’ Workgroup if I am not a Singaporean?
	
You must be a Singaporean or Permanent Resident to be eligible. Non-Singaporeans are welcome to volunteer for involvement as a resource person. 

### 4. Who is organising the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup?

The #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup is organised by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, with the support of partners and experts such as the Institute of Policy Studies. 

### 5. Why is it important to recycle more? 

In 2018 we generated almost 8 million tonnes of waste. We incinerate most of our waste to minimise what we send to Semakau Landfill. If we continue generating waste at this rate, our one and only landfill will run out of space by 2035. 

If we can improve the way we recycle, we can collect back items which might otherwise have been trashed. The recyclables can be made into new products such as construction materials and furniture. Recycling will therefore enable us to turn trash into treasure. This will allow us to keep our precious and finite resources in use for as long as possible, instead of drawing on new resources. This is what we call a circular economy approach.

### 6. Why is it important to improve the way we recycle at home? 

Under the [National Recycling Programme (NRP)](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/national-recycling-programme){:target="_blank"}, the public waste collectors (PWCs) licensed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) are required to provide recycling bins and recycling collection services to all HDB estates, private landed properties, and some condominiums/private apartments. 

The NRP uses a commingled collection system, ie, residents can throw paper, plastic, glass and metal recyclables into one blue recycling bin. These recyclables are then collected and sorted at the Material Recovery Facilities. 

NEA’s data shows that 40 per cent of items currently collected from our blue recycling bins cannot be recycled. This is because people put in unsuitable items, or recyclables stained with food and liquids. The food and liquids contaminate the other recyclables, which then have to be disposed as general waste and incinerated. If we can improve the way we recycle at home, we can improve our recycling rate.

### 7.	Where and when will the Citizens’ Workgroup meet for discussions?
	
Participants in the Citizens’ Workgroup must attend all four full-day sessions, which will be held on the following weekends (Saturdays and Sundays): 
* Sat 21 Sep, 9am to 5pm
* Sun 22 Sep, 9am to 5pm
* Sat 19 Oct, 9am to 5pm
* Sun 20 Oct, 9am to 5pm

Discussions will be conducted in English. Outside of these four sessions, participants are free to hold informal discussions amongst themselves. 

The #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup will be held at MEWR’s premises, located at Environment Building, 40 Scotts Road, Singapore 228231, Level 25. The venue is within walking distance from Newton MRT station. 

### 8. How is the Citizens’ Workgroup different from previous consultations or Focus Group Discussions on recycling?	
	
[Consultations and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)](/consultation/) are usually conducted within a day. Participants exchange ideas and give feedback to the facilitators, without the need to reach a consensus. 

The Citizens’ Workgroup will meet for several sessions over a longer period of time. Participants need to work with one another to investigate various solutions (while hearing from experts), and reach a group consensus on the recommendations to submit to the Ministry. Some participants may choose to work beyond the sessions to come up with more in-depth recommendations which may be supported by pilot trials.

The #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup’s recommendations will be published.  MEWR will provide a response to the recommendations and work with the participants to implement them where feasible.	

### 9. What is the end outcome? How does it benefit me?
	
Singapore’s domestic recycling rate has been stagnating at around 20 per cent. We hope that the recommendations by the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup will go some way to help us increase this to 30 per cent – a target set out in the -[Sustainable Singapore Blueprint](http://www.sustainablesingapore.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}.

Participating in the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup will provide you with a deeper understanding of the recycling landscape. It will allow you to partner Government in co-creating meaningful solutions which can make an impact on our environment. You will also have the opportunity to build new partnerships with other citizens with shared values. Collectively, we can build a more active and gracious community.

### 10.	Are there any monetary incentives?
	
We will cover transport expenses for all four sessions of the Citizens’ Workgroup. Breakfast, lunch and tea will also be provided.
