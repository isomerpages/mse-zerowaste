## Capacity Building
NEA runs training workshops that cater specifically to the needs of environmental interest groups and nongovernmental organisations (NGOs).

**Social Entrepreneurship Module**

This module helps participants understand the different definitions and concepts of social entrepreneurship, and the tools that can help make a
social enterprise successful. You will learn to apply the knowledge and draw examples from case studies to develop a sustainable business plan
to promote positive social and environmental changes.

**Volunteer Management Module**

This module focuses on key volunteer management principles and equips participants with volunteer supervisory skills. You will discover how to apply the best practices in volunteer management that are relevant to your outreach programmes.
