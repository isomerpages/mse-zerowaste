## Capacity Building

The Corporate Environment Champions (Corp EC) Programme by NEA provides training workshops to equip appointed representatives of various corporate and non-government organisations with the skills and knowledge to implement environmental initiatives. It also provides a platform for all Corp ECs to network and explore opportunities for collaboration.

**Engage: Project Management** 

This 1.5-day workshop focuses on practical training in project management that helps new Corp ECs to conceptualise, manage and publicise environmental programmes for their organisations. Participants also gain further insights through the educational site visit and sharing sessions by veteran NGO and corporate partners of NEA.

**Discover: Systems Thinking**

This module teaches Corp ECs to use Systems Thinking to develop holistic environmental initiatives from a macroscopic perspective. Systems Thinking is a useful tool that can help you reduce uncertainty in decision making, and respond to changing conditions quickly.

**Innovate: Design Thinking**

This Design Thinking workshop helps Corp ECs develop effective environmental programmes by adopting a consumer-centric approach that matches user needs with possible solutions to facilitate and influence positive behavioural change.

## Quick Starts in the office

Start an office recycling corner to cultivate good recycling habits among co-workers. Encourage the recycling of office supplies like paper, bottles, ink cartridges and electronic waste etc. [Follow the step-by-step
guidelines here!](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/resource/participate/3r-guidebook-for-offices.pdf){:target="_blank"}


Encourage your colleagues to practise 3Rs in the office such as printing on both sides of the paper or using their own cutleries and coffee mug. Here are some [3R tips](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/waste-minimisation-and-recycling/at-work){:target="_blank"} to get your started.



## Environmentally Friendly Events

Be a role model and show support for the environment through your actions. Make sure your event is an environmentally-friendly one. Refer to the following guides to help you [plan an eco-friendly event](https://www.mewr.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/faq/guide-to-implementing-environmentally-friendly-best-practices-for-events.pdf){:target="_blank"}.


## Funding

The [Towards Zero Waste Grant](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/towards-zero-waste-grant){:target="_blank"} has been created to support ground-up initiatives that drive waste reduction and recycling in any of the three key waste streams – packaging waste, food waste and electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) – or encourage households to recycle more and/or recycle right.

The [3R Fund](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/3r-fund){:target="_blank"} is a co-funding scheme to encourage organisations to implement waste minimisation and recycling projects. Any organisation in Singapore, including companies, non-profit organisations, non-government organisations, town councils, schools, institutions and managing bodies such as MCSTs can apply for the 3R Fund. Projects with new and innovative processes and concepts, and which target waste streams with low recycling rates such as food, plastic and glass will be given higher priority.
