Singapore’s inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan is an important step
towards our vision of a Zero Waste Nation. It encapsulates the
aspirations of Singaporeans and embodies the spirit of Singapore
moving forward as one – individuals, businesses, civil society and the
Government. It demonstrates our belief that the Government must
work with Singaporeans and for Singaporeans, to build a sustainable
Singapore.

Singapore has shown how economic growth, environmental protection
and social inclusion can go hand in hand. But we face new challenges.
As a low-lying island-state, climate change threatens our way of
life and existence. Addressing how we manage waste together with
Singaporeans also goes a long way to tackle climate change. That
is because our planet’s limited resources are increasingly strained
by rising consumption from global population growth and rapid
urbanisation, which contributes to more waste. Indeed, our only landfill,
Semakau Landfill, will run out of space by 2035 at current waste
disposal rates.

To overcome these challenges, and seize the opportunities in them,
we must collectively build three new resiliences:
* **Economic resilience** to ensure a robust economy that thrives in a carbon- and resource constrained world 
* **Climate resilience** to ensure Singapore is prepared to tackle the effects of climate change
* **Resource resilience** to safeguard our access to critical resources, such as food, water and energy.

The Masterplan will lay out Singapore’s strategies to build these
resiliences. Our economy is currently based on the linear “take-make-dispose”
model. We want to move away from this, towards a circular
one that reuses resources endlessly. To do this, we have set ourselves
an ambitious target – **we will reduce the amount of waste (per capita)
that we send to landfill by 30% by 2030**. This is on top of our existing
target to achieve a 70% overall recycling rate by 2030. We can achieve
these targets through sustainable production and consumption, and
transforming trash into treasure.

Sustainable production involves changing the way we do business.
Climate change, resource constraints and growing consumer demands
for sustainability mean companies will need new capabilities to
produce more with less. Products have to be designed more efficiently
and processes re-engineered. We will also need to push the boundaries
of applied science and develop new circular economy solutions. The
Government will support this through research and development, in close
partnership with industry and academia. In short, the problems that come
with climate change are also opportunities for companies to position their
businesses for.

Sustainable consumption, on the other hand, starts with us – a change
in our mindsets and behaviours. We designated 2019 as the Year
Towards Zero Waste to build a national consciousness to care for the
environment. Public participation has been very encouraging. More than
6,000 stakeholders participated actively in online consultations, surveys
and focus group discussions to refine the Zero Waste Masterplan with
us. Our industry has also provided extensive feedback, with more than
250 companies consulted. We will continue to work with you to inspire
changes through co-creation. A Citizens’ Workgroup to improve household
recycling in Singapore will start work in the coming months. Our quest
towards “Zero Waste” will be a long journey but we are heartened by the
strong start.

The Government has taken the lead to catalyse the transition to a circular
economy. We have introduced the landmark Resource Sustainability Act to
impose regulatory measures upstream. This addresses our priority waste
streams – Extended Producer Responsibility for e-waste, a mandatory
reporting framework for packaging waste, and mandatory segregation and
treatment regulations for food waste. Extended Producer Responsibility
will also cover packaging waste no later than 2025.

Even as we transform our trash into treasure, the global demand for waste
management and recycling solutions is projected to grow. [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/chemicals/our-insights/how-plastics-waste-recycling-could-transform-the-chemical-industry){:target="_blank"} has
highlighted the potential for a fourfold increase in plastics reuse and
recycling by 2030. This would generate US$60 billion in profit-pool growth
for the global petrochemicals and plastics sector. Such trends will drive
the demand for workers with skills in science, engineering, automation and
related capabilities. The Government will support industry transformation
and the upskilling of our workforce to create new economic opportunities
for local companies, and good jobs for Singaporeans.

This is our commitment. But the Masterplan cannot be effected by the
Government’s efforts alone. There is a role for everyone to play and we
must work as one. Only by doing so can we realise the full potential of the
Masterplan and ensure that future generations will continue to enjoy the
green and liveable island we call home.
