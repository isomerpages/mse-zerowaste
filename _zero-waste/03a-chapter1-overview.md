### Singapore has an efficient waste collection and disposal system. But if we wish to meet the new environmental challenges we face and continue to grow sustainably, we would need to change the way we view waste management and encourage everyone to consume less and conserve more.

#### Overcoming the environmental challenges of our past

Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s was
marked by night soil buckets, water rationing,
and unhygienic street hawkers.

Workers shovelled refuse from open roadside
bin points onto pushcarts, and discarded
them at open dumping grounds across
the island.

This form of waste collection was irregular
and inefficient. In 1964, only around 60% of
each day’s refuse was cleared. Refuse often
piled up along roads, in back alleys and other
common areas. This left streets reeking
of decomposing refuse and caused pest
problems, both made worse by the hot and
humid weather.

### The solid waste journey

Our waste management needs started
changing from the 1970s. Singaporeans
were moving from kampongs to high-rise
apartments, and competition for land became
more intense as the country developed.

#### CLEANING UP OUR STREETS THROUGH WASTE COLLECTION

To safeguard public health and avoid disease
outbreaks, we had to devise an organised
waste collection system.

This prompted the formation of the Ministry
of Environment (ENV) in 1972, now called
the Ministry of the Environment and Water
Resources (MEWR).

A district-based solid refuse collection system
was set up. Daily refuse collection services
for domestic and trade premises started
operating from seven district offices, and
refuse collection fees were paid through
household utility bills. Waste collection
vehicles also replaced pushcarts, making
collection faster and less strenuous for
workers.

#### DOWN THE CHUTE TO CLEANLINESS – TEACHING SINGAPORE TO “BAG IT”

As Singaporeans moved from kampongs to
high-rise apartments, vertical refuse chutes
were introduced as a quick and convenient
way to collect refuse from multiple flats.

Public housing flats built up to 1988 each
came with a refuse hopper in the kitchen.
Waste thrown into the chute fell into a bin at
the bottom that was emptied daily by refuse
collection workers.

But this collection system was unproductive
and took up too much space. Hence, in 1989,
the improved Central Refuse Chute (CRC) system was launched, where flats had a
common chute at the lift landing of each
floor. This allowed for more efficient refuse
collection.

In preparation for the shift to the CRC system,
ENV launched an educational programme
in 1986 to encourage residents to bag their
refuse before throwing it down the chute.
Educational posters showing the steps for
bagging waste were produced and distributed
across the island. It took many years for
Singaporeans to get it right, but it is a practice
that continues till today.

#### PIONEERS IN TURNING WASTE TO ENERGY

Reducing waste to just one-tenth of its
volume while generating electricity sounds
like a great way to make the most of our
waste.

But this was unimaginable in the 1970s in
Singapore.

It was only done in some parts of Europe and
Japan, which adopted waste-to-energy (WTE)
incineration, where electricity was generated
from waste incineration. These WTE plants
were also expensive.

But faced with a shortage of land for
landfilling, Singapore took a bold step in 1973
to build the first WTE plant in Asia outside of
Japan. In 1979, Singapore’s first WTE plant,
located at Ulu Pandan, was completed at a
cost of $130 million, a hefty investment at the
time.

Singapore took a $25 million loan from the
World Bank to fund the project, which marked
the first time the international financial
institution supported the construction of a
WTE plant.

Since then, four other WTE plants have been
commissioned – Tuas Incineration Plant
(1986), Senoko WTE Plant (1992), Tuas South
Incineration Plant (2000) and Keppel Seghers
Tuas WTE Plant (2009). Together, they
incinerate about 7,600 tonnes of waste a day.

By reducing the volume of waste by up to
90%, while generating electricity that is sold
to the grid, incineration has been an effective
method of waste disposal for Singapore.

While Singapore has achieved our aim of
developing a waste management system
that has safeguarded public health, we can
do more. We can recover valuable materials
from waste. This involves a paradigm shift to
manage our waste in new, more sustainable
ways to deal with our growing resource
constraints. [Read more about the science behind incineration](/science_behind_incineration/)
