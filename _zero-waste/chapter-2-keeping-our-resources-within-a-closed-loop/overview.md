### Through conscious design, more efficient operations and less wasteful habits, we can keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting their maximum value.

For decades, businesses and people around
the world believed that the earthâ€™s resources
would not run out. Many live by the linear
economy model whereby materials are
harvested, used to manufacture products, and
eventually discarded.

However, the global population continues to
grow and experts have sounded warnings of
resource constraints with consequences for
generations to come.

We need to change the way we view waste.
Rather than just something useless to be
buried or burnt, waste should be seen as a
valuable material that can be reintroduced
into the production cycle.

In other words, we want to adopt a
circular economy approach by keeping
our resources in use in an endless loop.
