### As Singapore grapples with climate change and mounting waste, we are investing in research and development (R&D) and collaborating with industry experts to develop new, more efficient and eco-friendly ways to support the circular economy approach by recovering resources from waste. 

Be it using microbes to convert food waste
into compost, or turning incineration ash
into construction materials – these are just
two of the many possible ways to close our
waste and resource loops through recycling
or reuse.

These innovations came about because
we have been experimenting with cuttingedge
science and technology for more
sustainable solutions.

For instance, R&D enabled the creation of
Semakau Landfill, the first offshore landfill
of its kind in the world, and Tuas Nexus –
the first Waste-to-Energy incineration plant
co-located with a water treatment facility to
reap synergies.

As we face increasingly pressing and complex
environmental issues, it is not enough to
rely solely on our current expertise and
infrastructure, or shape greener behaviour
with policies and regulations alone.
We will continue focusing on R&D to create
and refine new technologies, products or
systems that we can use and eventually share
with others. In the coming years, we hope
to pioneer transformative ways to enable
Singapore to maximise our resource use.

#### Overcoming challenges and creating opportunities, together

Developing cutting-edge technologies
requires collective effort, bringing together
the expertise and resources of academia,
enterprise and Government. Each has an
important role to play.

* Academia from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), Research Institutes (RIs) and polytechnics contribute deep scientific
knowledge, scholarship, and know-how to turn theoretical concepts into potential solutions
* Enterprises provide market experience and ideas, and in some instances, financial resources or manpower. They are crucial
partners for test-bedding R&D outcomes, scaling up solutions, and translating them into commercially viable applications
* The Government helps nurture and grow a thriving ecosystem, catalysing R&D by providing infrastructure, funding support,
policy guidance, platforms for collaboration, and test-bedding opportunities

Having a cohesive R&D ecosystem helps turn
ideas into commercially viable solutions. This
goes from envisioning and theorising the best
scientific approach to a given problem, testing
it in a laboratory, to piloting it under real life
conditions. Eventually, we will have a marketready
solution.

This approach benefits all parties. Academics
can see their ideas translated into real-life
applications, while enterprises gain new
business opportunities. All these boost
economic growth and create highly-skilled
jobs.

Our solutions could help other cities and
regions too, and position Singapore as a
global leader and centre of excellence in
waste management and circular economy
solutions.

<h4>CROSS-BORDER PARTNERSHIPS YIELD GREENER E-WASTE RECYCLING METHODS</h4>

<p>From extracting gold, silver and other precious
or strategic metals from printed circuit boards
without using harmful pollutants, to creating
greener chemical processes to recover
materials from laptop batteries – these are
just two tracks of R&D that the Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) Singapore-CEA
Alliance for Research in Circular Economy
(SCARCE) will focus on to develop less energyintensive
and more eco-friendly methods to
treat and recycle e-waste.</p>

<p>SCARCE is a research centre that the
French Alternative Energies and Atomic
Energy Commission (CEA), a renowned
multidisciplinary research centre in Europe,
has set up together with NTU, and is CEA’s
first joint laboratory outside France. It is also
the first and largest single recipient of funding
under the NEA’s Closing the Waste Loop R&D
Initiative, with the NEA committing $12.5
million towards this $20 million centre.</p>

<p>One of its research projects is to develop
eco-friendly methods of recycling lithium ion
batteries commonly used in laptops, mobile
phones and tablets. The goal is to extract up to
75% of the useful metals by weight, like cobalt,
nickel and lithium, from used batteries. These
can then be reused to produce new batteries.</p>

<p>Another project will look at extracting valuable
metals from printed circuit boards, which are
thin copper-plated or etched circuitry boards
that mount integrated chips and electronic
components in electronic equipment and
appliances. The target is to develop novel
methods to separate and recover metals,
organics and ceramics from these discarded
boards.</p>

<p>Local companies like Virogreen (Singapore) Pte
Ltd have plans to collaborate with SCARCE,
while TES-AMM (Singapore) Pte Ltd has
expressed interest in industrial-scale pilot
testing, to take the developed technology from
the lab to the industry.</p>

#### Our R&D investments to achieve zero waste

To improve technologies and solutions for
recovering resources from waste, and come
up with new ways to do the job, the NEA has
established two key R&D programmes.

#### CLOSING THE WASTE LOOP

Launched in December 2017, the Closing the
Waste Loop (CTWL) R&D Initiative is a $45
million programme that has funded eight
projects worth almost $20 million as of 2019.
The programme has three objectives:

* Resource efficiency – Develop ways to utilise resources efficiently and for as long as feasible. This includes better waste segregation, both at source and after disposal, which will maximise material and value recovery from waste. This ensures waste management processes are manpower, energy and water efficient.
* Landfill avoidance – Convert residues and waste (i.e. incineration bottom ash, incineration fly ash and non-incinerable waste) currently discarded at Semakau Landfill into useful resources, to extend the landfill’s lifespan beyond 2035.
* Maintaining high standards of public health – Besides protecting the environment, waste management (i.e. collection, recycling, disposal and treatment of waste) should be carried out in a safe and hygienic manner to maintain high
public health standards.

The CTWL initiative was developed with
collaboration in mind, to encourage
partnerships between IHLs, RIs and private
sector enterprises. These stakeholders were
consulted to develop the four themes under
the CTWL initiative, which goes hand in
hand with the Waste-to-Energy Programme,
to maximise the use of resources at every
opportunity.


Eight projects worth almost $20 million have been
awarded under the CTWL initiative
so far, and we will call for more
projects in the near future.
We will work with industry and
research stakeholders to identify
new focus areas of research.

**THEME 1 Segregation and value recovery**

Large amounts of leftover food, packaging
waste and discarded electrical and electronic
devices still end up at incineration plants
today. We want to increase the recovery rate
of valuable, usable materials from these key
waste streams, and lower the economic cost
and environmental impact of current
recycling processes.

<h4>A NEW LEASE OF LIFE FOR PACKAGING WASTE</h4>

<p>With no commercially viable way of
recovering plastic layers found in most of
the food, beverage and pharmaceutical
packaging today, these materials are
currently just incinerated.</p>

<img src="/images/ch6-potato-chips.jpg" alt="Potato chip packaging made of multilayer films">
<caption>Potato chip packaging made of multilayer films</caption>

<p>But scientists are now trying to break the
code to recycle these plastic-embedded
multilayer films (MLFs).</p>

<p>A team from A-STAR’s Institute of
Chemical and Engineering Sciences is
developing a chemical recycling method
that can separate and individually recycle
the different polymer layers from MLFs.
This makes it possible to extract valuable,
pure components that can then be reused
multiple times.</p>

<p>If successful, this chemical process could
also remove additives like colour pigments
and soluble polymers commonly found in
plastic goods.</p>

**THEME 2 Landfill conservation** 

Just as PUB reclaimed used water to develop
NEWater, the NEA is studying how to produce
“NEWSand”: an environmentally sustainable
product made from incineration ash that
can be commercialised. Finding ways to use
incineration ash, as well as non-incinerable
waste and industrial residues, will not only
extend the lifespan of our only landfill but
also avail Singapore of a new source of
construction materials.

As ash contains heavy metals, strict
standards are being developed to allow
NEWSand to be used in non-structural
concrete, road base and sub-base. This is
in view of the fact that much of land-scarce
Singapore has been or will be designated as
water catchments. Treated incineration ash
that meets these standards will be allowed
for unrestricted use in both moulded and
unmoulded forms, without polluting our water
resources.
The standards will be validated through a
demonstration project for incineration ash
treatment, and a field trial for treated ash.
The Land Transport Authority has identified
a suitable site for field trials, in which treated
ash will be used to lay the road base and
sub-base layers. Groundwater samples
will be collected and tested for changes in
environmental characteristics and compared
against samples of groundwater from a
nearby control site made from conventional
road building materials.

The design and results of the field trial will
be reviewed by a Technical Expert Panel
comprising experts in toxicology, public
health, environmental health, incineration
ash treatment methods, civil engineering,
and hydrogeology.

<h4>FROM ASH TO CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</h4> 

<p>In the future, ash left behind from burning
incinerable waste could be used to build our
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Researchers from Republic Polytechnic are
developing a solution to turn incineration bottom
ash (IBA) into construction aggregates that can be
added to produce ready-mixed concrete.</p>

<p>Their goal is not only to divert IBA from
landfilling, but also address rising market
demand for high quality aggregates. They
believe their product could be a sustainable
substitute for mined aggregates on the market.</p>
