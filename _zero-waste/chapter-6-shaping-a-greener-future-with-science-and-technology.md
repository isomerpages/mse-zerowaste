### As Singapore grapples with climate change and mounting waste, we are investing in research and development (R&D) and collaborating with industry experts to develop new, more efficient and eco-friendly ways to support the circular economy approach by recovering resources from waste. 

Be it using microbes to convert food waste
into compost, or turning incineration ash
into construction materials – these are just
two of the many possible ways to close our
waste and resource loops through recycling
or reuse.

These innovations came about because
we have been experimenting with cuttingedge
science and technology for more
sustainable solutions.

For instance, R&D enabled the creation of
Semakau Landfill, the first offshore landfill
of its kind in the world, and Tuas Nexus –
the first Waste-to-Energy incineration plant
co-located with a water treatment facility to
reap synergies.

As we face increasingly pressing and complex
environmental issues, it is not enough to
rely solely on our current expertise and
infrastructure, or shape greener behaviour
with policies and regulations alone.
We will continue focusing on R&D to create
and refine new technologies, products or
systems that we can use and eventually share
with others. In the coming years, we hope
to pioneer transformative ways to enable
Singapore to maximise our resource use.

#### Overcoming challenges and creating opportunities, together

Developing cutting-edge technologies
requires collective effort, bringing together
the expertise and resources of academia,
enterprise and Government. Each has an
important role to play.

* Academia from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), Research Institutes (RIs) and polytechnics contribute deep scientific
knowledge, scholarship, and know-how to turn theoretical concepts into potential solutions
* Enterprises provide market experience and ideas, and in some instances, financial resources or manpower. They are crucial
partners for test-bedding R&D outcomes, scaling up solutions, and translating them into commercially viable applications
* The Government helps nurture and grow a thriving ecosystem, catalysing R&D by providing infrastructure, funding support,
policy guidance, platforms for collaboration, and test-bedding opportunities

Having a cohesive R&D ecosystem helps turn
ideas into commercially viable solutions. This
goes from envisioning and theorising the best
scientific approach to a given problem, testing
it in a laboratory, to piloting it under real life
conditions. Eventually, we will have a marketready
solution.

This approach benefits all parties. Academics
can see their ideas translated into real-life
applications, while enterprises gain new
business opportunities. All these boost
economic growth and create highly-skilled
jobs.

Our solutions could help other cities and
regions too, and position Singapore as a
global leader and centre of excellence in
waste management and circular economy
solutions.

<h4>CROSS-BORDER PARTNERSHIPS YIELD GREENER E-WASTE RECYCLING METHODS</h4>

<p>From extracting gold, silver and other precious
or strategic metals from printed circuit boards
without using harmful pollutants, to creating
greener chemical processes to recover
materials from laptop batteries – these are
just two tracks of R&D that the Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) Singapore-CEA
Alliance for Research in Circular Economy
(SCARCE) will focus on to develop less energyintensive
and more eco-friendly methods to
treat and recycle e-waste.</p>

<p>SCARCE is a research centre that the
French Alternative Energies and Atomic
Energy Commission (CEA), a renowned
multidisciplinary research centre in Europe,
has set up together with NTU, and is CEA’s
first joint laboratory outside France. It is also
the first and largest single recipient of funding
under the NEA’s Closing the Waste Loop R&D
Initiative, with the NEA committing $12.5
million towards this $20 million centre.</p>

<p>One of its research projects is to develop
eco-friendly methods of recycling lithium ion
batteries commonly used in laptops, mobile
phones and tablets. The goal is to extract up to
75% of the useful metals by weight, like cobalt,
nickel and lithium, from used batteries. These
can then be reused to produce new batteries.</p>

<p>Another project will look at extracting valuable
metals from printed circuit boards, which are
thin copper-plated or etched circuitry boards
that mount integrated chips and electronic
components in electronic equipment and
appliances. The target is to develop novel
methods to separate and recover metals,
organics and ceramics from these discarded
boards.</p>

<p>Local companies like Virogreen (Singapore) Pte
Ltd have plans to collaborate with SCARCE,
while TES-AMM (Singapore) Pte Ltd has
expressed interest in industrial-scale pilot
testing, to take the developed technology from
the lab to the industry.</p>

#### Our R&D investments to achieve zero waste

To improve technologies and solutions for
recovering resources from waste, and come
up with new ways to do the job, the NEA has
established two key R&D programmes.

#### CLOSING THE WASTE LOOP

Launched in December 2017, the Closing the
Waste Loop (CTWL) R&D Initiative is a $45
million programme that has funded eight
projects worth almost $20 million as of 2019.
The programme has three objectives:

* Resource efficiency – Develop ways to utilise resources efficiently and for as long as feasible. This includes better waste segregation, both at source and after disposal, which will maximise material and value recovery from waste. This ensures waste management processes are manpower, energy and water efficient.
* Landfill avoidance – Convert residues and waste (i.e. incineration bottom ash, incineration fly ash and non-incinerable waste) currently discarded at Semakau Landfill into useful resources, to extend the landfill’s lifespan beyond 2035.
* Maintaining high standards of public health – Besides protecting the environment, waste management (i.e. collection, recycling, disposal and treatment of waste) should be carried out in a safe and hygienic manner to maintain high
public health standards.

The CTWL initiative was developed with
collaboration in mind, to encourage
partnerships between IHLs, RIs and private
sector enterprises. These stakeholders were
consulted to develop the four themes under
the CTWL initiative, which goes hand in
hand with the Waste-to-Energy Programme,
to maximise the use of resources at every
opportunity.


Eight projects worth almost $20 million have been
awarded under the CTWL initiative
so far, and we will call for more
projects in the near future.
We will work with industry and
research stakeholders to identify
new focus areas of research.

**THEME 1 Segregation and value recovery**

Large amounts of leftover food, packaging
waste and discarded electrical and electronic
devices still end up at incineration plants
today. We want to increase the recovery rate
of valuable, usable materials from these key
waste streams, and lower the economic cost
and environmental impact of current
recycling processes.

<div style="padding: 10px; border:10px solid #eeddca">

<h4>A NEW LEASE OF LIFE FOR PACKAGING WASTE</h4>

<p>With no commercially viable way of
recovering plastic layers found in most of
the food, beverage and pharmaceutical
packaging today, these materials are
currently just incinerated.</p>

<img src="/images/ch6-potato-chips.jpg" alt="Potato chip packaging made of multilayer films">
<caption>Potato chip packaging made of multilayer films</caption>

<p>But scientists are now trying to break the
code to recycle these plastic-embedded
multilayer films (MLFs).</p>

<p>A team from A-STAR’s Institute of
Chemical and Engineering Sciences is
developing a chemical recycling method
that can separate and individually recycle
the different polymer layers from MLFs.
This makes it possible to extract valuable,
pure components that can then be reused
multiple times.</p>

<p>If successful, this chemical process could
also remove additives like colour pigments
and soluble polymers commonly found in
plastic goods.</p>

</div>


**THEME 2 Landfill conservation** 

Just as PUB reclaimed used water to develop
NEWater, the NEA is studying how to produce
“NEWSand”: an environmentally sustainable
product made from incineration ash that
can be commercialised. Finding ways to use
incineration ash, as well as non-incinerable
waste and industrial residues, will not only
extend the lifespan of our only landfill but
also avail Singapore of a new source of
construction materials.

As ash contains heavy metals, strict
standards are being developed to allow
NEWSand to be used in non-structural
concrete, road base and sub-base. This is
in view of the fact that much of land-scarce
Singapore has been or will be designated as
water catchments. Treated incineration ash
that meets these standards will be allowed
for unrestricted use in both moulded and
unmoulded forms, without polluting our water
resources.
The standards will be validated through a
demonstration project for incineration ash
treatment, and a field trial for treated ash.
The Land Transport Authority has identified
a suitable site for field trials, in which treated
ash will be used to lay the road base and
sub-base layers. Groundwater samples
will be collected and tested for changes in
environmental characteristics and compared
against samples of groundwater from a
nearby control site made from conventional
road building materials.

The design and results of the field trial will
be reviewed by a Technical Expert Panel
comprising experts in toxicology, public
health, environmental health, incineration
ash treatment methods, civil engineering,
and hydrogeology.

<div style="padding: 10px; border:10px solid #3d91ad">
<h4>FROM ASH TO CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</h4> 

<p>In the future, ash left behind from burning
incinerable waste could be used to build our
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Researchers from Republic Polytechnic are
developing a solution to turn incineration bottom
ash (IBA) into construction aggregates that can be
added to produce ready-mixed concrete.</p>

<p>Their goal is not only to divert IBA from
landfilling, but also address rising market
demand for high quality aggregates. They
believe their product could be a sustainable
substitute for mined aggregates on the market.</p>

**THEME 3 Environmental remediation** 

Where trash from around the island once
accumulated, we believe our past landfills
can be rehabilitated and turned into reusable
land for future development. Therefore, one of
the focus areas under the CTWL initiative is
to investigate and characterise these closed
landfill sites, and use them as test-beds for
technologies and techniques that could make
them usable land again.

**THEME 4 Digital and data-driven management systems**

There is a need for systems to help monitor
and assess the effectiveness of the initiatives
we implement across the entire waste
management value chain.
We want to harness Information and
Communications Technology (ICT), such as
data analytics, to inform policy formulation
and infrastructure planning in waste
management and resource recycling.

#### WASTE-TO-ENERGY

Even as we try to maximise material resource
recovery from our waste, Waste-to-Energy
(WTE) remains a key strategy to extract value
from residual waste that cannot be effectively
reused or recycled. It also harnesses the
energy content to produce electrical energy,
while reducing the volume of residual waste
and prolonging the lifespan of our precious
Semakau Landfill.

To build up Singapore’s capabilities in
energy and value recovery from waste,
the NEA launched the $25 million WTE R&D
programme in 2014.

The programme has two aims.

#### AIM 1 - Boost energy recovery efficiency of WTE processes and methods

Today, Singapore’s WTE plants are not only
energy self-sufficient, but in fact supply
excess electricity to the national grid. Finding
more efficient WTE incineration processes
with higher electricity output will help them
meet a greater share of Singapore’s
energy needs.

![WTE Research Facility at Tuas South](/images/ch5-wte-research-facility.jpg)

For example, one approach is to use oxygenenriched
air. A team from NTU’s Nanyang
Environment and Water Research Institute’s
(NEWRI) Singapore Membrane Technology
Centre is developing membranes that can
efficiently produce oxygen-enriched air. They
are also modelling the feasibility of using
the membranes to enhance the current
incineration processes. The challenge lies in
extracting oxygen molecules from the air in a
cost-effective and energy-efficient manner.

Mr Masagos Zulkifli and President of Nanyang Technological University, Professor Subra Suresh, holding pieces of
concrete made with slag produced from the waste gasification processes. This highlights the potential of turning waste
into material for useful applications, which contributes to closing the waste loop.</caption>

#### AIM 2 Explore alternative WTE technologies

Alternative WTE technologies like gasification
provide more renewable energy options and/
or higher value products from waste with
minimal waste residues.

The WTE R&D programme aims to develop
alternative, novel methods suited to our local
context. For instance, Singapore’s municipal
solid waste streams are highly heterogeneous
and have high moisture content. Therefore,
foreign technologies may not be immediately
applicable in our situation.

By understanding our solid waste
composition, we will be better able to
generate useful by-products like better quality
syngas, while increasing the amount of
energy and resources recovered.

However, testing prototypes at existing
WTE facilities is not feasible due to the
disruption it would cause; neither are the facilities designed to accommodate such
trials. Recognising this problem, the NEA
contributed $12 million to co-fund the
construction of a WTE Research Facility
(WTERF) with NTU’s NEWRI. The Residues
and Resource Reclamation Centre of NEWRI
was tasked with the execution and project
management of the WTERF construction and
operation.

The $40 million WTERF provides local
researchers and industry players with a
physical, open platform for pilot testing.
Its plug-and-play features support
experimentation and test-bedding at scale,
bridging the gap between laboratory research
and commercial deployment.

The WTERF is the first of its kind in Singapore,
employing high temperature slagging
gasification as its underlying technology,
and was officially opened in May 2019.


**HOW DOES SLAGGING GASIFICATION WORK?**

#### Charting our next R&D steps

Even as new technologies emerge from
the CTWL R&D Initiative and WTE R&D
programme, we must think ahead and identify
new areas to study next. Only then can
we remain at the forefront of science and
technology.

We will look at how science and technology
can help us create circular, sustainable
systems of production, consumption, and
waste and resource management within
our economy.

Our key objectives are to:

* Develop viable substitutes for conventional materials
* Develop scalable technologies to separate waste into its constituents and turn them into resources and energy at lower economic and environmental costs
* Generate new, viable applications for resources generated from waste
* Integrate waste and resource streams systematically

With these principles in mind, research areas
relevant to Singapore include:

**SUSTAINABLE MATERIAL SUBSTITUTES**

Inventing easily recyclable substitutes
to commonly used materials will make
recycling and upcycling of waste cheaper
and more convenient. This could be in the
form of specially formulated non-metal
nanostructures (made of paper, for example)
that could replace metal electronic circuits
and wiring.

**NEW APPLICATIONS FOR RESOURCES HARVESTED FROM WASTE**

One promising area is nutraceutical
extraction, which involves extracting valuable
substances with medical or health benefits
from food waste.

Through research, we can identify useful
substances within common types of
food waste, and develop techniques to
hygienically and efficiently extract and
convert them into products fit for human
consumption.

For instance, bioactive compounds can be
extracted from vegetable and food wastes,
such as skins, stems, seeds, and residues
from oils, juices and sugar extraction. These
compounds can then be turned into high
value nutraceuticals and functional foods like
health supplements and food additives.

**INTEGRATING WASTE AND RESOURCE STREAMS**

Industrial symbiosis is a form of brokering,
where companies are brought together in
mutually profitable transactions. This involves
finding ways to use the waste from one
company as raw materials for another.

Research in this field explores better ways
of converting waste from one industry into
usable materials for another, or discovering
new, industrial-scale uses for existing waste
streams currently not recycled or reused.

Increasingly, we are focusing on the foodwater-
waste-energy nexus, to find ways each
sector can benefit from the other. This includes
extracting nutrients from our waste for use in
fertilisers in agriculture and horticulture.

By test-bedding such synergistic innovations
at scale, we hope to translate these into real,
commercially viable solutions.

Going forward, there will be ample
opportunities to pilot circular zero waste
solutions suited for local conditions, and
integrate them with other systems to maximise
district-level synergies.

Integrating these solutions into future housing
estates and town centres will show how R&D
helps fashion our living spaces into places
where we can live and work in a sustainable,
eco-friendly fashion.

#### Our R&D journey continues

By working closely with academia and
industry, we will guide our R&D efforts
to create economic opportunities for our
companies and jobs for our people.

In this way, we can successfully adopt a
circular economy approach to fulfil our vision
of a Zero Waste Nation where Singaporeans
can thrive and prosper.
