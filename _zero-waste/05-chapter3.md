### In Singapore’s journey towards a Zero Waste Nation, we are focusing on closing three resource loops: food, electrical and electronic equipment, and packaging, including plastics. Interventions through legislative and economic measures will target the entire value chain,  supported by infrastructure, research and development, and industry development.

#### Three priority waste streams

As Singapore prepares for an increasingly
carbon- and resource-constrained future,
with limited space for waste disposal, MEWR
and the NEA are pushing towards a wider
adoption of circular economy approaches,
where resources are used over and over
again, and waste is designed out of the
system. We have had some successes, like
the near 100% recycling rate for construction
and demolition waste and metals. However,
some types of waste are generated in large
quantities, but have a low recycling rate, such
as food and packaging. Though electrical
and electronic waste (e-waste) makes up
less than 1% of total waste generated in
Singapore, it could have a detrimental effect
on the environment if not properly managed.

This is why we have made food, e-waste,
and packaging, including plastics, our
three priority waste streams for closing the
resource loop and working towards our vision
of a Zero Waste Nation. The Government
will support the proper management of
these three priority waste streams through
a regulatory framework to promote resource
sustainability. The Resource Sustainability Act
is a landmark legislation introduced in 2019
to give effect to the regulatory framework.
Through legislation, the Government will
mandate the segregation and treatment of
food waste by large food waste generators
and impose the Extended Producer
Responsibility framework on producers and
retailers of electrical and electronic equipment
(EEE). The Government will also mandate the
reporting of packaging data and submission
of plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging
by producers of packaged products and
supermarkets.

These regulatory measures are expected to
drive demand and create a viable industry
for resource recovery in Singapore. They
have the potential to create net economic
benefit for Singapore and provide an earlymover
advantage in the global push towards
a circular economy. We hope to promote
innovative circular business models and
position our companies to seize opportunities
in the region for specialised waste treatment,
recycling or remanufacturing.

Regulatory measures are complemented
by outreach and engagement efforts to
businesses and consumers, to develop
sustainable production, consumption, and
waste and resource management habits
across the entire value chain.

More on these measures and efforts
will be shared in this chapter.


### Food

Despite Singaporeans’ love for food,
households are one of the largest generators
of food waste, contributing around half of the
food waste generated in Singapore.

According to an NEA study in 2016-2017,
each household disposed of 2.5 kg of
avoidable food waste each week. Rice,
noodles and bread were among the most
commonly wasted food items.

The amount of food waste generated has
grown by almost 30% over the past 10 years
and is expected to rise further with a growing
population. In 2018, food waste made up onefifth
of the total amount of waste disposed of
in Singapore, but only 17% of food waste was
recycled.

There is hope for improvement. The study
also found that more than half of the food
waste could have been prevented if people
were more mindful of how much food they
bought, ordered or cooked.

#### WHY WE SHOULD NOT WASTE FOOD

Food is an essential and precious resource.
Singapore is exposed to the volatilities of the
global food market as we import over 90% of
our food supply. As we work on strengthening
our food security, everyone also needs to play
a part by reducing food wastage.

Food waste also contributes to odour
nuisance in our general waste and attracts
pests, requiring more frequent waste
collection and increased truck traffic on
our roads.

By reducing food waste, we can also reduce
the contamination of recyclables, giving
recycling a boost.

#### CONSUMING FOOD SUSTAINABLY
The best way to manage food waste is
to avoid generating it from the outset.

The NEA has developed various resources
to encourage sustainable consumption of
food. This includes a [food waste reduction guide for consumers](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management/food-waste-management-strategies){:target="_blank"}, as well as [food
waste minimisation guidebooks for food
manufacturing establishments, food retail
establishments and supermarkets](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management/food-waste-management-strategies){:target="_blank"}. The
guidebooks aim to help such establishments
reduce food waste across the supply chain.

<caption>Food waste minimisation guidebooks developed by the NEA to help establishments reduce food waste across the supply chain</caption>


The NEA has also collaborated with different
organisations, including private organisations
and schools, to raise awareness of food
waste reduction through educational
materials.

Where there is unsold or excess food that is
still suitable for consumption, consumers and
food establishments can donate them to food
distribution organisations such as The Food
Bank Singapore, Food from the Heart, Willing
Hearts and Fei Yue Community Services.

But what about unavoidable food waste
that needs to be thrown away? With today’s
technology, we can adopt a circular economy
approach by viewing food waste as a valuable
resource. Food waste can be converted
into products like non-potable water, liquid
nutrient, compost and biogas for energy
generation.

#### ON-SITE: TREATING FOOD WASTE

On-site food waste treatment systems
convert food waste into non-potable water,
liquid nutrient or compost.

To kickstart the roll-out of such systems,
the NEA conducted a pilot project at a hawker
centre at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 Market
in 2016. It was found that active participation
and support of stallholders and cleaning staff
were crucial to the success of the project.

Similar systems have since been
implemented at several other hawker centres,
such as the hawker centre at [Our Tampines
Hub (OTH)](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1862380457141503){:target="_blank"} , Kampung Admiralty Hawker
Centre and Yishun Park Hawker Centre.

Apart from harnessing useful by-products
from food waste, recycling food waste can
save money too. At OTH, food waste is
converted into organic fertiliser, which is used
at its rooftop Eco-Community Garden and
distributed to members of the community at
the end of each month. This has contributed
to annual savings of about $40,000 from the
reduction in daily waste disposal charges
as food waste is no longer disposed of as
general waste.

Companies looking to put in place food
waste minimisation projects, including
the implementation of on-site food waste
treatment systems, can tap on the NEA’s
[3R Fund](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/3r-fund){:target="_blank"}.


#### OFF-SITE: TURNING FOOD WASTE INTO ENERGY

In 2016, the NEA and PUB conducted a
pilot at Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation
Plant where food waste – segregated at
source from general waste and deposited in
dedicated food waste bins – was collected
from 23 locations and mixed with used water
sludge. The combined food waste and used
water sludge undergoes a process called
anaerobic digestion, where biogas is formed
through microbial activity in the absence of
oxygen.

The pilot found that co-digesting food waste
and used water sludge can triple the biogas
yield as compared to digesting used water
sludge alone, thereby enhancing energy
generation. The NEA and PUB will be working
together to implement the co-digestion
process at the upcoming Tuas Nexus, where
the NEA’s Integrated Waste Management
Facility is co-located with PUB’s Tuas Water
Reclamation Plant.


#### BRINGING FOOD WASTE SEGREGATION TO HOMES

To gather insights on household routines to
encourage households to segregate food waste for
treatment, the “Food Waste? Don’t Waste!” household
food waste segregation and recycling pilot was
conducted by MEWR and the NEA, in collaboration
with OTH, the People’s Association (PA) and the
Tampines Town Council.

Since 1 August 2018, households in the Tampines
GreenLace HDB estate were provided with information
on how to separate food waste, as well as food waste
caddies and bags to collect their food waste.
Residents were asked to bag their food waste and
deposit them into food waste recycling bins located at
the foot of their block. The food waste collected was
then sent to OTH for treatment.

The pilot has yielded valuable insights on food
waste generation and disposal behaviours and
it has helped increase awareness of food waste
recycling amongst the residents of GreenLace
by more than 23 percentage points to 82% after
three months.

To build upon this awareness following the
pilot, we have partnered Zero Waste SG to
engage the residents and explore ways of
making their journey towards zero waste
even more meaningful. Some possibilities
include fully closing the food waste loop within
GreenLace via composting in a community
garden. We will continue to work with the
community for more opportunities
to reduce food waste.

#### THE FOOD WASTE SEGREGATION ROADMAP

Discarded food is not simply waste to
be incinerated. Instead, as shown in the
examples above, there is potential to turn
them into useful products.

Therefore, under the Resource Sustainability
Act, we will be making it compulsory to
segregate food waste for treatment.
