### Our zero waste vision is an endeavour that will require people in Singapore to come together. From individuals to households and industries, everyone has a part to play as we make our transition towards a Zero Waste Nation.

![launch of year towards zero waste](/images/ch7-zero-waste-launch.jpg)
<caption>2019 was designated as the Year Towards Zero Waste to rally Singaporeans to care for our environment
and treasure our precious resources</caption>

To become a Zero Waste Nation, we need to
change the way we live, work and play. This
includes curbing excessive consumption
habits in all aspects of our lives, harvesting
trash for treasure, consciously choosing
sustainable products and services, and
reusing resources for as long as possible.

The Government has set the direction of this
transformation and taken significant steps
to chart its course. We have facilitated the
setting up of infrastructure to collect, sort and
recycle different types of items and materials,
and have stepped up education to change
attitudes and behaviours towards reducing,
reusing and recycling.

But the Government cannot do this alone. We
need to partner businesses, individuals and
organisations to come up with innovative and
effective solutions. Over the years, MEWR and
the NEA have worked closely with partners
to undertake collective action for sustainable
development. As we embark on this
transformational journey together, we want to
uncover broader perspectives, listen to diverse
views, and bring together different segments of
society to co-create environmental solutions.


#### CO-CREATING SOLUTIONS WITH SINGAPOREANS

Since 2018, MEWR and the NEA have sought
the views of the public and other relevant
stakeholders on the Zero Waste Masterplan.
These stakeholders include:

**Industry stakeholders**

In 2018, the NEA consulted over 250
companies to gather ideas and views on
possible measures to address priority waste
streams.


**Households**

More than 5,000 households were engaged
through two door-to-door surveys, conducted
between June 2018 and February 2019.
One was a biennial survey, which focused
on households’ experience with recycling
services and infrastructure. The other was
commissioned specially for the Year Towards
Zero Waste to get a deeper understanding of
households’ recycling behaviour.


**Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)**

A dialogue was held with NGOs, youths and
other partners in February 2019 to seek their
views on MEWR’s zero waste plans and to
explore collaborations.


**General public**

More than 1,300 people participated in
a public consultation in March 2019 on
how Singapore can pursue sustainable
consumption and production, and build a
strong 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle right)
culture. In April 2019, MEWR conducted two
focus group discussions with 90 participants.
The discussions were co-organised with
NGOs Zero Waste SG and LepakInSG, and
centred on ways to reduce waste and to
encourage people to recycle right.

![photo of a focus group discussion](/images/ch7-fgd.jpg)
<caption>At the focus group discussion on 18 April 2019, participants discussed ways to reduce our consumption of
resources and encourage more to adopt a zero waste mindset</caption>


Through the various engagement sessions,
we found that people generally agreed that
it was important to make the 3Rs a norm
in Singapore. Many participants felt that
convenience was a key factor in nudging
people to put these principles into practice.
Many also felt that more education was
needed to raise awareness on waste issues,
and also called on businesses to promote
sustainable consumption.

#### CATALYSING GROUND-UP INITIATIVES

To effectively promote a zero waste lifestyle,
MEWR and the NEA work closely with
schools, businesses, community groups,
NGOs, and civil society groups to rally the
ground and raise awareness on waste
issues through their networks. Some of
these individuals and groups are carrying
out research that complement studies by the
Government. Others are facilitating dialogues
and gathering feedback, and have been
galvanising the local community to adopt
greener habits.

Here are some initiatives undertaken
by our partners:

**SEC plastic study and “One Less Plastic” campaign**

![One Less Plastic campaign](/images/ch7-onelessplastic.jpg)

chains, DBS and SEC as part of the “One Less Plastic”
campaign. Photo: SEC One Less Plastic Campaign</caption>

The Singapore Environment Council (SEC)
conducted a nine-month study on “Consumer
Plastic and Plastic Ecosystem in Singapore”,
which focused on three segments of the
plastic ecosystem:

* Upstream producers’ responsibilities including packaging
* Consumer lifestyles including recycling behaviour
* Downstream processes including waste management

The study, released in August 2018, found
that Singapore uses about 1.76 billion plastic
items each year. This prompted SEC to launch
a month-long “One Less Plastic” campaign in
December that year, to encourage shoppers
to swap single-use plastic bags for reusable
bags.

**Project Recycling**

The Climate Action SG Alliance, a group of
corporate and civil society leaders, produced
a series of videos to educate the public on
how to recycle right and to debunk myths
surrounding recycling. Three videos –
“Breaking Up with Plastic”, “What Can and
Cannot be Recycled”, and “Follow the Trash” –
were shared on social media channels.

**Industry efforts**

Getting businesses on board to support
Singapore’s drive to reduce waste and operate
sustainably is best done by an organisation
that understands their needs and constraints.

Since 2001, this role has been played by
the Waste Management and Recycling
Association of Singapore (WMRAS) –
the national trade body for local waste
disposal and resource recovery companies.

![Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore outreach sessions](/images/ch7-wmras.jpg)

youth about Singapore’s waste ecosystem. Photo: WMRAS</caption>

WMRAS and its 160 member companies
have been encouraging green practices
in the community through talks on waste
reduction and recycling. It also holds the
biennial WMRAS Excellence Awards to
recognise member companies that promote
environmental sustainability.

In 2017, WMRAS Academy started a
Professional Course in Waste Management
and Resource Recovery in collaboration with
Australia’s Griffith University for industry
workers to learn about sustainability,
waste reduction, recycling and the latest
environmental technologies.


**Schools and youth**

Beyond these specific initiatives, MEWR and
the NEA have been encouraging schools and youths to organise ground-up initiatives to
promote environmentally-friendly practices.

Since March 2019, MEWR, together with the
National Youth Council, has been engaging
youth leaders on our environmental policies
and programmes. Through their lens, we hope
to better understand youth perspectives on
sustainability, empower them to lead more
ground-up initiatives and to build a more
environmentally-conscious and gracious
Singapore.

Meanwhile, the NEA works closely with
schools to promote active learning and
participation in environmental initiatives by
providing funding support. The NEA also
organises platforms to showcase exemplary
student projects and facilitates networking
among schools.

For example, as part of the Youth for the
Environment Day in April 2019, the NEA
launched the Towards Zero Waste Challenge,
where schools were encouraged to avoid the
use of disposables when organising events.
Under the programme, schools received an
electronic guide on how to conduct Zero
Waste events and other related activities.

![Students from Mee Toh School](/images/ch7-meetoh.jpg)

project “The SORT-CERER” at the North East Clean and
Green Singapore 2018. The project aims to encourage
recycling through a simple game and has won the best
project at the North East G!nnovation Challenge 2018</caption>

Many schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning have also organised their own
ground-up initiatives to encourage staff and
students to reduce waste. For example, in
Bukit View Secondary School’s canteen, no
plastic straws are provided and reusable
cutleries and containers are made available
for staff to pack food. Canteen stall vendors
also impose a small charge on disposable
packaging to further discourage its use.
At the National University of Singapore
(NUS), infographics on recycling are set as
wallpapers and screensavers on computer
screens in the lecture theatres. Other campuswide
initiatives at NUS include a 10-cent
plastic bag tax, and Bring Your Own (BYO)
schemes like Project Box and Project Tumbler
that reward patrons for bringing their own
reusables for takeaways.

A “[Towards Zero Waste Grant](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/towards-zero-waste-grant){:target="_blank"} ” was set up in
2019 to fund ground-up projects that drive
waste reduction and recycling, or encourage
households to recycle more and recycle right.

Community Development Council, hopes to drive Active
Recycling through educating residents on proper
recycling techniques and bonding the community
through a common platform to sort recyclables.

#### PARTNERSHIPS BEYOND BORDERS

The environmental challenges that we
face are not unique to Singapore. Common
challenges include a mounting waste
problem, greater resource constraints and
climate change. We can learn from the
experience and expertise of other countries,
while sharing ours as well.

Singapore welcomes partnerships with
countries and institutions that share the
vision of a global circular economy where
resources are used efficiently, proper recycling
and clean recyclables support economic
activity, and innovation and technology push
the boundaries of resource recovery.

![Visit to the Abu Dhabi Waste Management Center (Tadweer)](/images/ch7-tadweer.jpg)
<caption>Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, visited the Abu Dhabi Waste Management
Center (Tadweer) to learn about Abu Dhabi’s waste management plan and systems, and public outreach efforts</caption>

Such partnerships are becoming increasingly
important as our world becomes more
globalised and interconnected. The
movement of materials will inevitably cross
national boundaries, and international
cooperation is key to leveraging the
opportunities from sustainable production,
consumption and waste management. As
a responsible member of the international
community, Singapore will continue to uphold
the rules-based approach to addressing
environmental challenges and fulfil our
international commitments.

This is why we have partnered countries like
China, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Oman, Jordan and the United Arab
Emirates. We have signed Memorandums
of Understanding, engaged them in policy
exchanges, and worked together on industry
workshops and demonstration projects.
Singapore hopes to promote greater
collaboration on policies, best practices and
technologies to strengthen our capacity to
drive the shift towards a Zero Waste future.
One example is the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city (SSTEC), the second Government-to-
Government project between Singapore and
China. It was designated by China’s Ministry
of Environment and Ecology as one of China’s
16 Zero Waste pilot cities/areas in April 2019.
Singapore’s contributions enabled SSTEC to
meet key environment-related performance
indicators on waste reduction and recycling,
among others. Having been designated a
pilot Zero Waste city, further novel zero waste
environmental solutions and initiatives will be
explored using a circular economy approach.
The aim is to establish a replicable zero waste
reference model for other Chinese cities/areas.

Another good example is the Singapore-Japan
E-waste Management Forum organised by
the NEA and the Ministry of the Environment
of Japan. The forum was held in June 2019
and saw 150 industry leaders and delegates
exchange ideas and information on electrical
and electronic waste management strategies.

#### SUSTAINED 3P PARTNERSHIPS

The Year Towards Zero Waste has triggered
the momentum for action, and we will
continue to build on our partnerships with the
3P (private, public and people) sectors. We
believe in expanding our democracy of deeds,
where Singaporeans actively contribute and
shape our future.

As part of our sustained engagement efforts,
MEWR is convening a Citizens’ Workgroup
to co-create solutions with Singaporeans,
to improve the way we recycle at home.
One of the key objectives is to reduce the
contamination rate of the blue recycling
bin, which is currently at 40%. The Citizens’
Workgroup will include Singaporeans from
diverse backgrounds. Members will be given
access to data as well as subject matter experts
who can share their expertise and help with the
piloting and implementation of solutions.

We will continue to align our efforts with those
of other Government agencies, adopt a sciencebased
approach, and work with businesses,
international partners, civil society groups
and individuals to co-create solutions for a
sustainable Singapore.

Together, we can move closer towards our
vision of becoming a Zero Waste Nation.
