### Through conscious design, more efficient operations and less wasteful habits, we can keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting their maximum value.

For decades, businesses and people around
the world believed that the earth’s resources
would not run out. Many live by the linear
economy model whereby materials are
harvested, used to manufacture products, and
eventually discarded.

However, the global population continues to
grow and experts have sounded warnings of
resource constraints with consequences for
generations to come.

We need to change the way we view waste.
Rather than just something useless to be
buried or burnt, waste should be seen as a
valuable material that can be reintroduced
into the production cycle.

In other words, we want to adopt a
circular economy approach by keeping
our resources in use in an endless loop.

### What is a circular economy?

Unlike the linear economy, the circular
economy focuses on designing waste out of
the resource ecosystem and maximising the
value of resources by keeping them in use for
as long as possible.

Many countries, such as the Netherlands,
Finland, China and Japan, already adopt this
approach in their national agenda, driven by
resource scarcity, volatile resource prices, and
the environmental impact from extraction and
excessive use of resources.

Even as we learn from other countries, we
need to examine Singapore’s context and
pinpoint how a circular economy is relevant
to us. Adopting a circular economy approach
can help to contribute to building up three
“Resiliences” to sustain Singapore’s future.

The adoption of the circular economy
approach will require measures to be
taken across the entire value chain, from
production and consumption to waste and resource management. Measures include
better product design that reduces the
amount of resources used at production,
change in consumer habits where products
are repaired instead of replaced with new
ones, and the recycling of waste and their
reintroduction into the value chain.

<caption>A circular economy approach will require measures to be taken across the entire value chain</caption>

We have already embraced the circular
economy approach in several areas through
our successes in closing a number of
resource loops. Almost all construction
waste and metals are recycled.

We have also closed the water loop. By
combining water and sanitation, Singapore
is able to endlessly recycle water, reusing it
again and again. Every drop of used water
is collected and treated, turning much of it
into drinking water again. This has allowed
Singapore to reintroduce up to almost
800,000 m<sup>3</sup> of ultra-pure recycled water into
our system each day.

### SETTING NEW TARGETS TOWARDS ZERO WASTE

Under the [Sustainable Singapore Blueprint
2015](http://www.sustainablesingapore.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}, we set the 2030 target of increasing
our national recycling rate to 70%, domestic
recycling rate to 30% and non-domestic
recycling rate to 81%.

Through the adoption of the circular economy
approach and the efforts outlined in this
Masterplan, we want to go beyond
these targets.

![our zero waste targets](/images/ch2_targets.png)

Achieving this target will require the
successful implementation of the various
measures outlined in this Masterplan,
including those to better manage our priority
waste streams of food waste, e-waste and
packaging waste, including plastics.

Support from all segments of society will also
be needed to take closing our waste loop to
the next level. Individuals should play their
part by recycling right and not contaminating
our blue recycling bins. Businesses that
produce the most electrical and electronic
equipment or packaging will be required to
take a life-cycle approach to products. Large
food waste generators must also ensure
that food waste is properly segregated and
treated.

Lastly, the research and development
community will be crucial in developing
solutions and technologies that enable us
to turn our waste into resources, such as
through the use of incineration bottom ash by
turning it into [NEWSand](/newsand/).

<h3>WHAT DOES THE WASTE-TO-LANDFILL REDUCTION TARGET MEAN FOR EACH PERSON?</h3>

<p>Today, each person disposes of 800g of
waste per day.</p>

<p>To achieve our waste-to-landfill reduction
target of 30%, each person needs to reduce
the total amount of waste they dispose of
per day to 640g by 2030. This adds up to a
reduction of about 30 bananas or 15 glass
bottles per month. It’s that simple!</p>

#### Sustainable production

When companies better manage their
resources and reduce the amount of waste
generated from conducting their business,
both the environment and their
bottom line stand to benefit.

How can they produce sustainably? Some
ways include sustainable design, improving
resource efficiency, and adopting industrial
symbiosis where companies use the waste
of others as raw materials for its own
operations.

#### SUSTAINABLE DESIGN 

Designing products to be more durable and
repairable lengthens their lifespan, delaying
their entry into the waste stream. Creating
them with materials and components that
could be taken apart easily also makes them
easier to recycle.

The National Environment Agency (NEA)
has been encouraging companies to reduce
their packaging waste through the [Singapore
Packaging Agreement](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/schemes/singapore-packaging-agreement){:target="_blank"}, a voluntary agreement formed in 2007 among the Government,
companies, industry associations and nongovernmental
organisations.

Now we are stepping up this effort. The NEA
will introduce [mandatory packaging reporting](/#/)
in 2020 for producers of packaged products
and supermarkets and target to implement
an [Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)](/#/)
framework for managing packaging waste
including plastics no later than 2025.

Companies are also coming together to
take action through better product design
and processes. For example, as of June
2019, 15 food and beverage (F&B), retail
and hospitality companies, including Hilton
Singapore, Kraftwich and SaladStop!,
have committed to reducing their plastics
production and usage by 2030 through
the World Wide Fund for Nature’s (WWF)
voluntary agreement – [Plastic Action (PACT)](https://www.wwf.sg/business/pact/){:target="_blank"}.
As part of PACT, over 270 F&B outlets in
Singapore have also phased out plastic
straws (as of 1 July 2019).


#### PROMOTING RESOURCE EFFICIENCY

As the world population grows, competition
for resources will increase. According to a
2017 report by the International Resource
Panel, global material resource use is
expected to double between 2015 and 2050
based on current trends.

The report highlighted the need to adopt resource efficiency policies and initiatives, which could save $2.9 to $3.7 trillion a year by 2030. This will also cut resource use by 26% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 20% by 2050.

This global shift towards greater resource
efficiency presents opportunities for
Singapore companies and industries to
be leaders in this area and reap economic
benefits.

We are already making headway in improving
energy efficiency. For instance, the [Energy
Conservation Act (ECA)](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/industrial-sector/mandatory-energy-management-practices-for-existing-industrial-facilities){:target="_blank"} requires large energy
users to adopt good energy management
practices. This includes conducting
regular energy audits, setting up an energy
management system, and submitting energy
efficiency improvement plans.

Companies also track their materials efficiency
through sustainability reports such as
those required by the Singapore Exchange
of Singapore-listed companies. The reports
cover five primary components: (a) material
Environmental Social Governance (ESG) factors,
(b) policy, practices and performance, (c) targets,
(d) sustainability reporting framework and (e)
Board statement.

However, the commercial and industrial sector
still contributes around half of total waste
disposed of. Material and waste audits can thus
allow companies to identify opportunities for
reduction through a systematic evaluation of
material flows and costs, and develop concrete
plans to improve material efficiency. We will be
exploring means to support more companies to
do this.

At the same time, the Sustainable Manufacturing
Centre (SMC) of the Agency for Science,
Technology and Research (A-STAR) aims to
promote sustainability in the manufacturing
industry by bringing industry associations and
the research community together to work with
Government agencies to develop and implement
sustainable manufacturing technologies.

<h3>TWEAKS IN PACKAGING SAVES COMPANY MATERIALS AND MONEY</h3>

<p>By making a crucial material swap, a packaging
company helped its client save money.</p>

<p>Instead of packing its client’s product – a Field
Replacement Unit (FRU) – in a polypropylene
moulded case, Greenpac (S) Pte Ltd designed a
paper carton box with polyethylene foam which
did the job just as well.</p>

<p>This reduced the overall weight of packaging from
5 kg to 1.5 kg, saving 53,000 kg of packaging
material and $6,000 in material costs per year.</p>

<p>This, and several other initiatives, won Greenpac
an Excellence Award (SMEs) at the Singapore
Packaging Agreement Awards in 2017.</p>

#### BRINGING TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO THE INDUSTRY

The Model Factory @ Advanced
Remanufacturing and Technology Centre
of A-STAR offers capabilities and expertise
in three areas underpinning smart
manufacturing. It provides companies with
a platform to learn how technologies are
implemented in manufacturing use-cases
or test process improvements without
disrupting their own operations.

![Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre](/images/ch2_ARTC.jpg)

**Secure connectivity and intelligent system**
Real-time analytics allows for decentralised
decision making, while condition monitoring
provides data for predictive model and
optimisation. Together, they make factories
more intelligent, and in turn more agile and
efficient.

**Virtual manufacturing**
With a full digital footprint of a factory, every
machine and process will generate real-time
information that will provide the data required
for optimisation, decision-making, planning and
learning. Meanwhile, virtual design will shorten the
product design life cycle and the need for physical
prototypes. The use of augmented reality will help in
training operators and machine maintenance.

**End-to-end solutions**
The end-to-end digital thread, from customer-specific
orders, product design and manufacturing to aftersales
service, provides seamless data exchange
and new business opportunities. These digital
threads also enable better supply chain
management and management of distributed
manufacturing assets globally.


#### PROMOTING INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS

Industrial symbiosis refers to mutually
beneficial collaborations, where what is
deemed as waste by one company could be
raw material for the operations of another.
This leads to more sustainable industrial
processes and cost savings.

To optimise such alliances, both entities are
typically sited within close proximity to reduce
transportation costs, and their infrastructures
are carefully designed.

Industrial symbiosis can also be applied to
brownfield sites, where waste-resource flows
are matched by an independent organisation.
The Finland Industrial Symbiosis System
(FISS) is one example. To date, there are
around 600 companies and 4,700 resources
involved in the FISS.

In Singapore, industrial symbiosis is
illustrated through the design of the Tuas
Nexus, where the NEA’s Integrated Waste
Management Facility will be integrated with
PUB’s Tuas Water Reclamation Plant. Output
from one facility will be used as feedstock to
another, while keeping the land use footprint
and environmental impact to a minimum.
(See Chapter 4 for more details on Tuas
Nexus.)

Similarly, at upcoming districts such as
Jurong Lake District and Punggol Digital
District, Government agencies across various
domains are working together to optimise
resource flows and minimise transport within
the district. For example, we are exploring
closing waste loops at the district level, such
as by converting food waste into useful
products like compost, which can be used
for landscaping.

<h3>STUDYING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY ON JURONG ISLAND</h3>

<p>Singapore is home to Jurong Island – one
of the top 10 chemical parks in the world
and a key anchor for Singapore’s energy
and chemicals industry. It is an example of
industrial symbiosis, facilitated by shared
infrastructure and an inter-connected
industrial cluster. To remain competitive,
Jurong Island companies have been seeking
to optimise resources, such as water and
energy, and also to minimise waste in their
own plants.</p>

<img src="/images/ch2_jurong_island.jpg">
<caption>Aerial view of Jurong Island. Photo: JTC</caption>

<p>The close proximity of related industries on
Jurong Island provides an ecosystem where one
company’s product can become the feedstock
of another. For example, waste from some
companies is burnt to generate steam for
industrial use. Similarly, wastewater is recovered
and recycled for industrial use.</p>

<p>However, there are limitations to the efforts by
individual companies. Increasingly, companies
are recognising the importance of collaboration
so as to jointly discover opportunities for further
resource optimisation at the systems level.</p>

<p>To deepen this industrial symbiosis, companies
on Jurong Island have come together to support
a study commissioned by JTC Corporation (JTC)
– the Jurong Island Circular Economy Study. The
study seeks to bring about environmental and
economic gains for companies by mapping out
the current water, energy, and waste flows on
Jurong Island, and to identify further synergies
and reduce resource use at the systems level.</p>

<p>It is the next step towards positioning Jurong
Island as an economically and environmentally
sustainable chemicals park. The study is
ongoing, with recommendations targeted to be
ready in 2020.</p>
