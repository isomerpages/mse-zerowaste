How can we improve the way we recycle at home?

### Our challenge

The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has jumped seven-fold over the past 40 years. Although we incinerate our waste to conserve space at our only landfill, Semakau Landfill will be filled up by 2035 if we continue to waste resources at our current rate. To address this, we need everyone to make it a habit to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

About 60 per cent of Singaporean households are already recycling regularly. Unfortunately, many do not realise that items soiled with food and liquids should not be put into the blue recycling bin. Food and liquids contaminate other recyclables in the blue bin, which then have to be trashed rather than recycled. Today, the contamination rate of blue recycling bins is high, at 40 per cent. 

If we can improve the way we recycle, we can collect back items which might otherwise have been trashed. The recyclables can be made into new products such as construction materials and furniture. Recycling will therefore enable us to turn trash into treasure. This will allow us to keep our precious and finite resources in use for as long as possible, instead of drawing on new resources. This is what we call a circular economy approach. 

### Join us!

We are recruiting Singaporeans to work with us to co-create solutions to improve the way we recycle at home.

As a Workgroup participant, you will have the opportunity to meet and consult with subject matter experts in the waste management and recycling industry. You will also have the chance to network with fellow Workgroup members to discuss ideas, come up with proposals, and partner us to implement them.

All recommendations proposed by the Workgroup will be considered by MEWR, and implemented if feasible.
