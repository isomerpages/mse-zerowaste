Each day, about 600 refuse trucks roll
into Tuas South Incineration Plant (TSIP),
Singapore’s fourth and largest WTE plant.

Before tipping their waste load into a bunker,
the vehicles are weighed at the weighbridge.

Air pressure in the bunker is kept below
atmospheric pressure to contain the stench,
while crane operators mix the waste to ensure
the composition is homogenous before
feeding it into six incinerators.

After the waste is unloaded, the vehicles are
weighed again to determine the amount of
waste disposed of.

The $890 million TSIP, commissioned in 2000
on a 10.5 ha plot of reclaimed land, uses an
advanced combustion control system to
control the combustion process so that the
waste is completely burnt.

To ensure that harmful gases are not emitted,
the flue gas produced from the combustion
process passes through an electrostatic
precipitator and catalytic fabric filter system.
This removes the dust particles, neutralises
the acidic contents and breaks down dioxins
into harmless gases before it is emitted
through two 150 m-tall chimneys.

The heat produced from the incineration
process is harnessed to produce
approximately 1,600 MWh of electricity per
day. About 20% powers the plant and the
remaining 80% is exported to the grid.

By the end of incineration, waste would have
been reduced by up to 90% of its original
volume, substantially reducing the amount of
space it would otherwise have taken up in our
landfill.

After incineration, the metals in the
incineration bottom ash, such as iron,
steel, aluminium and copper, are extracted
before the ash is transported to the offshore
[Semakau Landfill](/semakau_landfill/).

The final destination for all incineration
ash and non-incinerable waste is Semakau
Landfill. It is bounded by a 7 km-long
perimeter bund which is lined with an
impermeable geomembrane to contain the
waste. Monitoring wells are located along the
bund and water samples are regularly taken
to ensure water quality is not compromised.
