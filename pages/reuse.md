### **Reuse Materials**

You can "reuse" materials in their original form instead of throwing them away, or pass those materials on to others who could use them too! Remember, one man's trash is another man's treasure! Here are some examples of reuse...

#### At home

**Paper**
* Convert scrap paper into memo pads

**Plastic**
* Reuse medicine containers for travel toiletries
* Use unwanted plastic bags to contain household waste before displosal into refuse bins or chutes
* Use reusable bags when doing grocery shopping

**Glass**
* Reuse used glass containers as receptables

**Clothing**
* Use old clothing as rags for cleaning
* Pass on old clothing in good/usable condition to others

**Others**
* Reuse your mouse pad as an insulator for placing hot objects, or as a coaster
* Pass old textbooks, story books, and toys to others
* Repair and recondition faulty electronic appliances to extend their useful lives
* Clean and reuse ornaments for the next festive season


#### At school

* Use both sides of paper for writing, calculations and problem solving, etc.
* Donate unwanted uniform that is still in good condition to the school for redistribution to needy students.
* Donate unwanted story books that are still in good condition to the school library.
* Compost organic waste into soil conditioners or fertilisers for planting in the school garden.
* Reuse plastic and glass containers to water plants or as pots for planting.
* Donate unwanted items in good/usable condition to charitable organisations


#### At work
* Reuse used envelopes for sending internal mail
* Remove old documents and reuse files for filing again
* Use the other side of used paper for drafting, printing and taking notes, etc
* Approach the supplier to see if it will take back excess materials
* Look for ways to use a waste as a raw material in another process
* Look for ways to avoid contamination of a waste so that it can be put back into the originating process as a substitute for a raw material
