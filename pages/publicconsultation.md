The inaugural [Zero Waste Masterplan](/zero-waste-masterplan/) details our upcoming policies for waste management. We plan to pursue circular economy strategies by reusing and recycling resources, turning trash into treasure and producing and consuming sustainably.

It will take a whole-of-nation effort to achieve our vision of a Zero Waste Nation. Realising the ambitions of our Zero Waste Masterplan will require strong partnerships to co-create and implement new solutions. 

It is important that the Masterplan incorporates views from all sectors. The Masterplan has thus been shaped by numerous engagements and consultations with companies, NGOs, research and educational institutions and individuals. Just last year alone, the National Environment Agency consulted more than 250 companies on measures to address our key waste streams.  

More than 1,300 respondents also took part in our online public consultation in March 2019. This was followed by two focus group discussions in April.

We thank you for your ideas and suggestions. The findings from the online consultation and the focus group discussions will help us formulate an actionable and sustainable Masterplan.
