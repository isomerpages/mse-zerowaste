![Let's enjoy food, not waste it! In Singapore, we love food. But sometimes, we order, cook or buy more than we need, especially during the festive season. This leads to food wastage.](/images/dabao2.png)

![Sharing is caring!Invite the neighbours over for a party, or share your mooncakes with family, friends or colleagues! 
Bonus: you share the calories too!](/images/dabao7.png)
![Spread the Love! Received too many mooncakes as gifts this year? Consider donating your sealed and unopened mooncakes to charities that will redistribute them to needy families. This way, you can spread the mid-autumn spirit!](/images/dabao8.png)
![Upcycle with the family! Mooncake boxes have gotten more lavish in recent years, but instead of letting all that packaging go to waste, why not turn it into a family activity with the kids? The boxes can be upcycled into stationery boxes, or even lanterns! Get creative!](/images/dabao9.png)
![If you're thinking of recycling the mooncake box, DON'T! Mooncake packaging is difficult to recycle as it is made of multiple materials, not just paper or plastic. For example, it may contain decorative items such as tassles, gold studs, ribbons, etc. ](/images/dabao10.png)
![Turn Trash into Treasure! What do you do with pomelo peels after you have consumed the fruit? One way you can maximise this resource is by composting the peels to create plant fertiliser, so the circle of life can continue!](/images/dabao11.png)
