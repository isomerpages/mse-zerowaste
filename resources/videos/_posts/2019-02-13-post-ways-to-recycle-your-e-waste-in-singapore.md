#DidYouKnow that there are over 400 e-waste recycling bins located around Singapore? They are located in the shops of retailers such as Starhub, Singtel, Best Denki, Courts, Gain City and Harvey Norman.

We are working to create more channels for residents to send their e-waste, through implementing a regulated e-waste management system in the future. In the meantime, our National Voluntary Partnership for E-waste Recycling brings together industry and community partners and assists them in spearheading e-waste recycling programmes, including the setting up of e-waste collection points.

Find out from Uncle Lim what are some of these programmes, and how you can make a difference by reducing and recycling your e-waste.
