Congratulations on your new home! Here’s some good news – we’ve worked with IKEA to add some style to your recycle right efforts with a cool bin from IKEA.

From 1 August 2019, about 18,000 residents of Built-to-Order flats in new HDB precincts will receive a voucher, which can be used to redeem* the recycling bin sponsored by @IKEASingapore. Keep a look out for your voucher! Find out more [here](http://bit.ly/2GENgLo)

*Redemptions can be made after 24 August 2019.
