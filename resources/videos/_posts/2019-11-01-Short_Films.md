#### Repair 

Singing the national anthem, reciting the pledge, watching and participating in the National Day Parade — these are all part of our shared experiences as Singaporeans.

How far would you go to retrieve such a precious memory? And how rewarding such a journey can turn out to be. 

This National Day, watch grandfather and grandson, Osman and Mikhail, as they recapture a lost memory through a simple repair.
