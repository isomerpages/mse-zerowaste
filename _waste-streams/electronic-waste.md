### Singapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste a year. That’s equivalent to discarding about 70 mobile phones per person in Singapore! This number is expected to increase with greater spending power and new technologies constantly replacing old ones.

#### Why is this a problem?

E-waste refers to electrical and electronic waste, such as computers, laptops, mobile phones and TVs. While these items can often be refurbished, repaired or recycled, they are usually discarded instead. Not only does e-waste contain valuable and scarce materials such as silver and gold, there are also small amounts of harmful substances such as cadmium and lead that could potentially harm our environment and health if not handled properly.   

![e-waste infographic](/images/Co2.jpg)

When e-waste is disposed of and incinerated, it results in the loss of resources as well as carbon emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. E-waste also contains small amounts of heavy metals that can be hazardous to the environment and health. Hence, recycling our e-waste reduces the amount of heavy metals in our incineration ash.

#### What is the government doing? 

Building on existing voluntary e-waste recycling initiatives in Singapore, an e-waste management system will be established by 2021. Through the **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** framework, responsibilities will be assigned to the key stakeholders in the e-waste value chain. 

Under the EPR framework, producers of covered electrical and electronic equipment will be required to take on responsibility for the collection and proper treatment of e-waste. These producers are companies that manufacture or import covered electrical and electronic equipment for supply on the local market. 

![E-waste](/images/e-waste.jpg)

For example, producers have to ensure that their products are properly recycled upon reaching their end of life, by fulfilling e-waste collection targets and channelling the e-waste collected to formal recyclers. 

As retailers are the touch points for consumers, the e-waste management system will also rope in retailers to provide convenient collection options for consumers.

Some of the e-waste types that will fall under the EPR framework include information and communications technology (ICT) equipment, solar photovoltaic panels, batteries and lamps, and certain household appliances. 

When producers are responsible for the ‘end-of-life’ of their products, they will be more incentivised to design products that are easily recycled, or come up with innovative circular business models to close their waste loop.

#### What can you do an individual?

**1. Buy only what you need**

Dealing with e-waste starts with the way we consume our resources. Start by asking yourself before each purchase: “*Do I really need this*?”. If the item is indeed something you cannot do without, the next question is if you can reduce on your carbon footprint, such as the following:

*“Do I need a brand new one, or will a second-hand option fulfil my needs?”*
*“How often will I use this? Could I borrow the item from my neighbour?”*
*“Are there reusable options (such as rechargeable batteries) that I can consider?”*

There are many ways we can save the Earth; all we need to do is to pause and consider our options to reduce our consumption and carbon footprint. 

**2. Repair instead of replace**

![how to repair e-waste](/images/repair.jpg)

Instead of throwing away a faulty electrical appliance, you can send it for repair or learn how to repair them yourself. Not only does repairing your own items give you a sense of accomplishment; it helps you save money and protect the environment! 


**3. Donate your usable items**

![donate e-waste](/images/donate.jpg)

You may not have use for the electronic device anymore, but that does not mean it is of no use to others! 

If you feel like you’ve had the item for some time and would like a change, why not pass the old one to someone who needs it? Donating these items for reuse prolongs their lives and thus conserves our natural resources.

**4. Recycle e-waste at designated bins**

![how to recycle e-waste](/images/recycleewaste.jpg)

If the item is broken and can no longer be repaired or used, it should be recycled. Recycling allows for materials such as gold, silver, copper and plastics to be recovered and made into new products. We forgo this when we dispose of our e-waste and have them incinerated.  The simple act of recycling reduces the amount of new materials being used and our carbon footprint. 

*How to recycle your e-waste?*

Recycling e-waste is best done through recycling points put in place by recycling programmes. This ensures that the items are sent to recycling facilities that dismantle and recycle e-waste in an environmentally-friendly manner. E-waste also comprises many different components, and these facilities can also extract the maximum amount of recyclable materials from e-waste using specialised equipment.

#### What can you do as a business?

* Instead of purchasing entirely new devices or systems, start by replacing pieces of your equipment or update firmware and software as long as you can.
* When it's time for a tech refresh, consider selling your IT equipment to companies that can refurbish or recycle them properly! Also, make sure to wipe out sensitive data before they get sold!
* Consider purchasing equipment from companies who run  end-of-life takeback schemes
