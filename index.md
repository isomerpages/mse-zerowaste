      description: Close to 40% of what goes inside our blue recycling bins cannot be
        recycled. This is because people put in things that cannot be recycled
        or contaminate the recyclables with food and liquids. We are recruiting
        Singaporeans to work with us to co-create solutions to improve the way
        we recycle at home.
