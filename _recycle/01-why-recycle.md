### Recycling converts waste into useful products and conserves natural resources. It also reduces the need for incineration and extends the lifespan of Semakau Landfill

Recycling is a great way to protect the environment. Did you know that:

* Recycling 1,000kg of paper saves 17 trees.
* Recycling an aluminium can saves 95% of the energy used to make a new one.
* Recycling a glass bottle saves 30% of the energy used to make a new one.
 
### Our 2030 Recycling Targets

Of the waste generated in 2018, more than half - almost 4.63 million tonnes - was recycled. 

Singapore has set a national recycling rate target of 70% in 2030, with 
* an increase in domestic recycling rate from 22% in 2018 to 30% in 2030, and 
* an increase for non-domestic recycling rate from 74% in 2018 to 81% in 2030.
